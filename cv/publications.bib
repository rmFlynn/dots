	abstract = {Background The murine CBA/J mouse model widely supports immunology and enteric pathogen research. This model has illuminated Salmonella interactions with the gut microbiome since pathogen proliferation does not require disruptive pretreatment of the native microbiota, nor does it become systemic, thereby representing an analog to gastroenteritis disease progression in humans. Despite the value to broad research communities, microbiota in CBA/J mice are not represented in current murine microbiome genome catalogs.Results Here we present the first microbial and viral genomic catalog of the CBA/J murine gut microbiome. Using fecal microbial communities from untreated and Salmonella-infected, highly inflamed mice, we performed genomic reconstruction to determine the impacts on gut microbiome membership and functional potential. From high depth whole community sequencing (~42.4 Gbps/sample), we reconstructed 2,281 bacterial and 4,129 viral draft genomes. Salmonella challenge significantly altered gut membership in CBA/J mice, revealing 30 genera and 98 species that were conditionally rare and unsampled in non-inflamed mice. Additionally, inflamed communities were depleted in microbial genes that modulate host anti-inflammatory pathways and enriched in genes for respiratory energy generation. Our findings suggest decreases in butyrate concentrations during Salmonella infection corresponded to reductions in the relative abundance in members of the Alistipes. Strain-level comparison of CBA/J microbial genomes to prominent murine gut microbiome databases identified newly sampled lineages in this resource, while comparisons to human gut microbiomes extended the host relevance of dominant CBA/J inflammation resistant strains.Conclusions This CBA/J microbiome database provides the first genomic sampling of relevant, uncultivated microorganisms within the gut from this widely used laboratory model. Using this resource, we curated a functional, strain-resolved view on how Salmonella remodels intact murine gut communities, advancing pathobiome understanding beyond inferences from prior amplicon-based approaches. Salmonella-induced inflammation suppressed Alistipes and other dominant members, while rarer commensals like Lactobacillus and Enterococcus endure. The rare and novel species sampled across this inflammation gradient advance the utility of this microbiome resource to benefit the broad research needs of the CBA/J scientific community, and those using murine models for understanding the impact of inflammation on the gut microbiome more generally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.CBAJ-DBThe CBA/J databaseMAGMetagenome assembled genomevMAGViral metagenome assembled genomeASVAmplicon sequencing variantNTSNon-Typhoidal SalmonellaMQHQMedium and high-qualitydMQHQDereplicated medium and high-qualityAMGAuxiliary metabolic geneiMGMCintegrated Mouse Gut Metagenomic CatalogMGBCMouse Gastrointestinal Bacterial CataloguePXRPregnane X receptorFXRFarnesoid X receptorAhRaromatic hydrocarbon receptorSCFAShort chain fatty acid},
