Thank you for taking time to consider this application for the \jname{} at \cname{}.
I am a Computer Science and Statistics professional focused on Data Science, Software Development, and Machine Learning.
I have a strong background in these subjects, and would love the opportunity to \opportunity{}.

In addition to a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, I hold a master's degree in \degree{}.
Through my degrees, I have received formal training in \class{}, and have sharpened these skills in industry.
For example, I was previously a graduate intern at NREL for the grid modeling team, preparing data to run on the last generation of NREL's HPC.
%I recently finished work on a thesis applying machine learning to a large \thesisdata{} data set.
I have 5 years of experience, both in industry and academia, managing data and writing programs in the research industry.
Most recently, I have been embedded in the award-winning Wrighton lab as a Research Software Engineer,
using test-driven development to build ETL pipelines, analyzing TB of data and using tools like Plotly, P5.js, and  Matplotlib to create visuals of results.  
% using test-driven development to analyze spatial and time series data, and using tools like P5.js to create animated visuals of results.  
%interfacing with talented students and domain experts to enable research into the effects of the microbiome on agriculture, ecosystems, and climate.
\extratwo{}
% My first degree Bachelors of Science in Mathematics focusing in Statistics.
% I have a long history working in Linux, and it is my preferred development environment.

With this background, I have a deep understanding of the needs and challenges unique to making software for science and research.
I hope to
%CUT
once again
%CUT
work productively with \colabs{} at \cnameshort{}.
I continually strive to perfect skills, gain knowledge, and make work that I can be proud of.
I would be honored to do so as part of your team.
  \closing{Sincerely,}
