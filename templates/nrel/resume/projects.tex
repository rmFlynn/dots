\nonbox{\project{DRAM2}{Aug. 2022}{Work assignment}{In progress}
{Large re-write of the DRAM metagenome annotation toolkit and pipeline. Intended to bring the tool kit up to modern standards of python development, add revolutionary features based on probabilistic graphs, provide massive speed improvements, and fully modularize design.}}

\nonbox{\project{Cut the Music}{Sept. 2022}{Hobby}{In progress}
{Improve the experience of your favorite podcasts when relaxing or sleeping by removing distracting musical interludes. This is done with pre-trained ML models.}}

\nonbox{\project{Read Mapping No Problem}{Sept. 2022}{Work assignment}{In progress}
{Professional implementation of a complex E:LanguageToolSetUpTL pipeline, integrated with HPC scheduling software. Writen in Python and Snakemake.}}
% \project{NGS Data Processing Pipeline}{Finished, January 2021}
% {A pipeline to process NGS Data, filter subjects, and reduce dimensionality using lineage disequilibrium clumping. }

\nonbox{\project{Talking GAN Project}{Nov. 2021}{Graduate Project}{Finished}
{A Generative Adversarial Network, featuring a U-Net design, that generates video of a speaking human mouth using only voice audio and a still picture of a mouth. }}

\nonbox{\project{Contagion View GTK Project}{Jun. 2020}{Graduate Project}{Finished}
{A desktop application, created in GTK3, that can be used to visualize the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. It features an interactive map, linked time series plots, and multiple data filters.}}

%\project{Sleep Stage Prediction With Bioelectric Signals}{Finished, December 2019}
%{
%Tested a set of ML algorithms to identify sleep stages using data from a lightweight in-ear sensor.
%We experimented with several types of waveform data, along with features extracted from waveform measurements.
